# Conducting a Security Audit

## Introduction

In this project, I will be conduction a security audit using a scenario provided in the Google Cybersecurity Professional course. 

## Step 1: Intentify Complience

In this step, I will be reviewing the support documents provided (also attached to this repository) to indentify if the company is complient.

## Step 2: Fill out Control and Complience Checklist

I will be filling out a Control and Complience Checklist to determine if the company is complient with security standards. (The completed checklist will also be added to this repository for anyone to review)
